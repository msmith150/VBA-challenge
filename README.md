# VBA-challenge
 Module 2 Weekly Challenge

 Classroom materials were used as the primary sources for this script.  I also utilized/consulted Xpert Learning Assistant for workbook/worksheet assistance (i.e. ensuring the script applied to all worksheets).  For the match function in VBA, I utilized https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/vba-application-match/ and the Excel Is Fun Youtube Channel.  While searching online, I also identified a similar use of the match function from another bootcamp assignment from two years ago (https://github.com/DrewBarnhart/vba-challenge/blob/main/StockAnalysisCodeFINAL.txt) and modified mine after viewing this one.
