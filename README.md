In this project, I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data by looping through all the stocks for each quarter and outputting the following information:

- The ticker symbol

- Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

- The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

I then added functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 


*edEX Bootcamp classroom materials were used as the primary sources for this script.  I also utilized/consulted Xpert Learning Assistant for workbook/worksheet assistance (i.e. ensuring the script applied to all worksheets).  For the match function in VBA, I utilized https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/vba-application-match/ and the Excel Is Fun Youtube Channel.  While searching online, I also identified a similar use of the match function from another bootcamp assignment from two years ago (https://github.com/DrewBarnhart/vba-challenge/blob/main/StockAnalysisCodeFINAL.txt) and modified mine after viewing this one.
